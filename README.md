# ✨ Advent of Code - 2023 ✨

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, written in Java. Each day's solution is organized in a separate package, making it easy to navigate and understand.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.
Each puzzle grants one ⭐.

## Overview

Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars ⭐ to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems. You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
